[![Rubinho][1]][7]

Rubinho is a [RubyGems][2] visualization tool. Here is the [NPM][3] counterpart. The visualization is done using [VivaGraphJS][4]. Also check out [yasiv][5] for more inspiration.

I found the icons with Google Images search and put them on top of each other. If you know their original authors please contact me. The loading GIFs are generated with [loadinggif][6]
